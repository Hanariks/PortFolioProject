Project Name: COVID-19 Data Exploration

Project Description: This project aims to explore COVID-19 data from different continents to gain insights into the impact of the virus on different regions. The project utilizes various SQL techniques such as Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Converting data Types to perform data analysis and visualization.

Data Sources: The data used in this project is sourced from two tables:

Coviddeath$ - This table contains COVID-19 data such as total cases, new cases, total deaths, and population, among others, for different countries across different continents.

CovidVaccinations$ - This table contains data related to COVID-19 vaccinations, including new vaccinations, total vaccinations, and people vaccinated, among others, for different countries across different continents.

SQL Techniques Used:

Joins: Used to join the Coviddeath$ and CovidVaccinations$ tables to combine the data.
CTEs: Used to create a temporary table to perform calculations on the data.
Temp Tables: Used to create temporary tables to store data and perform calculations.
Windows Functions: Used to perform rolling calculations on the data.
Aggregate Functions: Used to perform calculations such as finding the maximum value of a column and the sum of a column.
Creating Views: Used to create a view to store data for later visualization.
Converting Data Types: Used to convert data types such as integers to floats and vice versa.
Key Findings: Some of the key findings of the project include:

The likelihood of dying if one contracts COVID-19 in one's country.
The percentage of the population infected with COVID-19 in different countries.
The countries with the highest infection rate compared to their population.
The countries with the highest death count per population.
The continents with the highest death count per population.
The percentage of the population that has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine in different countries.
Potential Next Steps: Some potential next steps for this project include:

Visualizing the data using tools such as Tableau or Power BI to create interactive dashboards and reports.
Analyzing the data further to gain more insights into the impact of COVID-19 on different regions.
Updating the data regularly to track the progress of the pandemic and observe any changes in trends over time.
